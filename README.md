# MatlabLiveFaceAndDigitRecognition
Recognising Faces whose dataset is available and also digits 0-9 using Alexnet for Feature Extraction. 

This project is another implementation of matlab example - https://in.mathworks.com/help/nnet/examples/feature-extraction-using-alexnet.html

⦁	Folder 'My_numeric_data' contains pictures of digits(0-9). 
⦁	Download Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB
	https://in.mathworks.com/products/neural-network/apps.html 
⦁	Download Alexnet 
	https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-neural-network-toolbox-tm--model-for-alexnet-network 
⦁	Resize the image dataset if you are recognizing a new object
⦁	Run the Digits.m file for recognition of digits
⦁	Run the Face.m file for recognition of faces
